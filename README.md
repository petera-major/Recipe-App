SmartPantryMuse -Recipe App

Description: This recipe app enables users to discover meal ideas based on their preferences and goals. When entering the app the user chooses their goals (for example weight loss, vegan, improving their relationship with food). Based on their goals the app suggests recipes via the database. Also, users are able to interact with an AI recipe assistant to enter ingredients that they currently have for five personalized meal recipes based on their preferences.

* Helping users build better relationships with food
